# Feature Partitioned Forest

This repository contains the implementation of *Feature Partitioned Forest* proposed by **Calzavara *et. al.*** in their research paper titled [<em>Feature partitioning for robust tree ensembles and their certification in adversarial scenarios</em>](https://jis-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13635-021-00127-0).


## Requirments
In order to train [Robust Trees](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chen19m.html) we used the implementation provided in the following repository: [treant](https://github.com/gtolomei/treant).
